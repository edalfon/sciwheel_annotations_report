<body>

Copy here the External API token from your Sciwheel account:
<input type="text" id="sciwheelAuthToken" name="sciwheelAuthToken", style="width: 300px;">


<div id="status"></div>
<button id="save_btn">Save</button>
<div id="status_delete"></div>
<button id="delete_btn">Delete</button>

<div>

  <br/>

  Don't know what that is?, or how to get it?

  <br/><br/>

  It is basically the way you authorize us to access data from your Sciwheel 
  account. This extension uses Sciwheel's API to download the annotations from 
  the reference of your choice. But 
  <a href="https://sciwheel.com/resources/Sciwheel_API_documentation.pdf">
    "API can only be used to retrieve data from user accounts for which you 
    have a valid access token." 
  </a>

  <br/><br/>

  Now, how do you get yours? 
  <br/><br/>

  Quoting Sciwheel's documentation again:
  <br/>
  <a href="https://sciwheel.com/resources/Sciwheel_API_documentation.pdf">
    An access token can be generated by any user by performing the following steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Sign in to Sciwheel with the relevant user</li>
      <li>Go to My Account > External API</li>
      <li>Here you can view/copy your token or generate a new one 
        (please note that generating a new token will
        invalidate any existing token for this user account)</li>
    </ul>
  </a>

  Don't worry. You only have to do this once. If you synchronize Chrome with 
  your Google account, we will store the token there and it will be available 
  for you to use this extension without further configuration in other machines.
  Please note that, while stored locally, the token is not encrypted.
